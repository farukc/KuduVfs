### KuduVfs

KuduVfs is an implementation of IFileSystem (System.IO.Abstractions) back by [Kudu's Vfs](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki).

It includes the library (VfsFileSystem) and companion operation executables (like xcopy, dir, mkdir del, rmdir etc.).

### Disclaimers

It does not have a complete implementation of all IFileSystem contracts.  However, it should be sufficient to a subset of file operations.

### Documentation
